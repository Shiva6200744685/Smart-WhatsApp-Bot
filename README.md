The Smart WhatsApp Bot is an intelligent, feature-rich chatbot built on the whatsapp-web.js framework, designed to enhance productivity, simplify communication, and bring automation directly to your WhatsApp inbox.

Using OpenAI's powerful language model, the bot reads incoming messages and replies with contextually intelligent responses. Whether it’s casual conversation or specific queries, the bot ensures natural, smart, and helpful interactions—24/7.

🧠 Smart Reminders
Never forget important tasks or events again! The bot allows users to set personal reminders with natural language instructions. It intelligently parses messages like "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM" and sends timely alerts directly in the chat.

💻 Send Messages from Terminal
The bot features a developer-friendly command-line interface, allowing messages to be sent from the terminal with a simple format. This is perfect for testing or automating communications via scripts.

The bot detects when users send images or other media and responds accordingly, maintaining conversational flow even with non-text messages.

🔄 Contextual Replies
Every response is threaded and connected to the original message using message.reply(), making conversations seamless and context-aware.
